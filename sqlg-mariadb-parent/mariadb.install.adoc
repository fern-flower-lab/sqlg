```
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE sqlgraphdb;
CREATE USER 'mariadb'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mariadb';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mariadb'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mariadb' WITH GRANT OPTION;

//seems need to include sqlgraphdb.*
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sqlgraphdb.* TO 'mariadb'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mariadb' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

The server might have create an anonymous user on localhost, delete it...

```
DELETE FROM mysql.user where User = ''and Host = 'localhost';
```
